ayodeji sanya - CASE 7131861371- I am responding to an over charging of my AWS account which was brought to my knowledge on this case 
I would like to indicate that the charges were under free tier and all instances and resources , I was not using the resources at the time and the understanding 
I had was that I was under a free tier period for 12 month . I am shocked that I was asked to pay such an amount during a period as this . 
I am considering moving my solution to more cost effective credible environment.
